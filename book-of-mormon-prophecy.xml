Many of these prophecies are based on the words of Isaiah. Nephi, Jacob, and Jesus use his words as a point of reference to describe an endtime scenario. That scenario depicts the pivotal role Latter-day Saints will perform in restoring the house of Israel—the Jews, Israel’s Ten Tribes, and the Lamanites. Serving as spiritual kings and queens under the terms of the Davidic Covenant, these servants of God deliver them spiritually and physically in a time of worldwide calamities. Learn more of what the Book of Mormon is telling us in the light of Isaiah’s prophecies and how they clarify much of what was unclear to us before." %}
